\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Provides two new styles: 1.
 An 'In Preamble' style that puts whatever is entered into it into the preamble.
 This can be used, if one wishes, to include preamble code in the body of
 the LyX document.
 2.
 An 'In Title' style that will put its contents into the body of the LaTeX
 document, but before 
\backslash
maketitle is issued.
 This is useful for making branches and notes in title-related material.
 (If you put these in a Standard layout, this signals to LyX to output 
\backslash
maketitle, which may then come too early.)
\end_layout

\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Adds environments to define header and footer lines.
 NOTE: To use this module you must set the 'Headings style' in the menu
 Document Settings -> Page Layout to 'fancy'! Package(s) required: fancyhdr.sty.

Trying to define what is "optimum" looking at vibration and efficiency.
 Guyton is looking at minimizing vibration as the key and it's harder to
 assess since it's a graph and not a number whereas the efficiency is a
 given power number.
 Shawn brings up the fact that we're letting Mach float which normally isn't
 a customer acceptable condition, so optimizing presents a problem since
 we would need to keep the Mach constant so that condition would need to
 change based on the optimum.
 Perhaps add to the matrix, okay we optimize these things and then get to
 the condition where we started and keeping Mach condition and see where
 that places us in keeping where we need to be.
 Think of guide vane being controler with vane 1 is for fine tuning.
 Take all of it and bring it to condition to see final point.
 Wall and bypass have little effect so fine tune vanes as final.
 Can't be just vibrations but concern of flow quality additionally.
 Once P0 is finished for 0.7 which Mach going to next? Vote says : M=1.3->1.1?
 go from steady to the more tempermental point.

For kulites need to subtract the mean zero wind off point from the live

 The compressor data is already in engineering units and the differential

817 - Some shuddering going on that could be heard and felt as they are
 trying to establish a different condition were trying to head to 1.3 but
 vibration levels went off the chart so easing off P0 before they head to
 1.3, dropped the pressure to around 1045 psf to make the transition easier
 on the compressor.
 Will not do 1.1 at 2000 psf due to the problems encountered as mentioned
 above.

 trying to optimize a bit on the vibration levels before heading for 1.3.
 And now things are now okay and reached 1.3 and will now bring the pressure
 up slowly and everything is okay.
 *** Slow changes best for Transonic section in vane settings and pressure
 best practice to prevent vibrational problems***

909 - Compressor not so happy at the moment with some change they are making,
 fairly consistent shudder that has a consistent frequency falling with
 the fan speed.
 Belief is that once get off that "sweet spot" then just always going to
 be unhappy, dropping pressure to calm the system down.
 Still an unhappy sound even with the pressure dropping.
 Walls and vanes were being changed, going to try sneaking back up to 2000
 psf, but still has a rough sound even though the vibrations are not being
 felt, the monitor must be an acceptable level if they are bringing the
 pressure back up.

Burst 34 is noise, what does constant level with spikes mean? Why does it
 only go one direction? Could be a bias depending on what it looks like
 when it's off.
 The behavior of one direction is odd so perhaps due to the placement being
 on the hinge of the door.
 It was tested before install on the shaker to test the sensor.
 Loose connector since overall frequency content is low? particularly compared
 to the more broadband noise observed in cone.
 Likely okay since the off condition shows the same peaks for both accelerometer
s.
 So do see some content addition from tunnel on over the tunnel off condition.
 Likely real vibration with some possible bias.
 If take the mean out of what is there from the already subtracted mean
 might see a normal peak to peak profile of which we are expecting.
 Possibililty of seeing some expansion? (Discussion with Chad) Will need
 to take a look at the sensor before sent out to PMel and taken down.
